# PSHelper
PSHelper will help in performing some daily activity like 'Scheduled Shutdown','Abort Shutdown','Password Manager','Close All Windows'
It’s a PowerShell GUI application written using PowerShell script that will help you in performing few activities.
Example: Scheduled Shutdown, Abort Shutdown, Password Manager, Close All Windows

Scheduled Shutdown: User can specify the time of shutdown and click on execute. The system will auto shutdown in the specified time. It Can help in nightly execution. You can trigger a Scheduled Shutdown so that when the time comes, and your execution is done you system will auto shutdown.

Abort Shutdown: I have triggered an Auto shutdown, and the system will be going to shut down in the given time, but I got some more Test cases/Tasks for execution, which may take some more hours.
Means now I don’t need the earlier schedule because I want my system to be active for some more time, so I want to cancel the earlier scheduling and create a new one.
For the above scenario we have Abort Shutdown as an action.
You can select Abort Shutdown and click on execute then the earlier schedule will get canceled and user will get a notification!

Password Manager: We generally write password in Notepad and store it. Saving passwords on Notepad is like writing your credit / debit card PIN numbers on a piece of paper and leaving it out in the open. There is absolutely no protection in Notepad as far as security is concerned, your passwords will vanish in an instant if you close it without saving.
Imagine You have shared the screen some one has seen it or taken picture or recorded it, what's next?
Our application can prevent this, we have option to Save Password(Which is a one-time operation) and Get Password.
We store passwords in encrypted format. Even someone seeing the code will not be able to identify the password.

Close All Windows: Though this is a very small feature and just to give an example I have added this.
We generally have many windows open while working and closing those one by one is quite hectic so this script can help you with that in just one click.
Select the action as Close All Windows and confirm the action the click on execute and you can see all of them got closed.
